# AI-Virtual-Motion-Controller-Python-Open-CV-
Developed an AI-powered virtual mouse that tracks hand gestures to control the cursor.  Implemented real-time gesture recognition and mapping using computer vision techniques.  Enhanced user interaction without physical hardware input.
The main objective of the proposed virtual AI mouse is to furnish an alternative to the conventional physical mouse that provides mouse functions with the help of computer vision enabled computer that houses a web camera which recognizes fingers and hand gestures and processes the captured frames and uses a machine learning algorithm to execute the defined mouse functions like moving the cursor, right click, left click and scrolling function. Also we are using multiple libraries to perform this project.
